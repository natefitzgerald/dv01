# a non-aggregated index where you can get all the relevant fields at once
GET     /                           controllers.MainController.index

# aggregation endpoints - these use all the data by default
GET     /by-state                   controllers.MainController.byState

# calculates _extremely_ basic statistics on for the field selected
# valid values do need to be preselected at compile time via inclusion in the RelevantFields object
GET     /stats-by-field/:selectedField                   controllers.MainController.statsByField(selectedField: String)

# this essentially functions as a group-by, grouping by the first parameter to provide stats on the second param
GET     /agg-by-field/:aggregationField/:aggregatedField                   controllers.MainController.AggregateByField(aggregationField: String, aggregatedField: String)
